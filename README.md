# Aviation Accident Risk Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes aviation accident data to help stakeholders within a company identify the safest types of aircraft for potential investment. The analysis explores patterns in accident severity, aircraft damage, and flight phases, providing data-driven recommendations for minimizing fatal risk.



##  Business Understanding

The company is expanding into the aviation industry and needs to understand the risks associated with different types of aircraft and conditions to make informed purchasing decisions.

###  Stakeholder

The primary stakeholder is the Head of the Aviation Division, who will use this analysis to guide investment decisions.

###  Key Business Questions

- What types of accidents are most likely to be fatal?
- Which aircraft damage types or flight phases are associated with fatalities?
- How have fatal accidents changed over time?


##  Data Understanding and Analysis

###  Source of Data

- **Dataset:** National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Aviation Accident Database  
- **Files Used:**
  - `AviationData.csv`
  - `USState_Codes.csv`

### Description of Data

The dataset includes:
- Event details (date, location, phase of flight)
- Aircraft information (type, damage, engines)
- Injury counts (fatal, serious, minor)
- Environmental conditions (weather)
- ~88,000 accident records spanning from 1962 to 2023


###  Visualizations

#### 1.  Fatal Accidents Over Time
>Line chart of number of fatal accidents per year  
 Fatal accidents have generally decreased over the decades, especially after 2000.

#### 2.  Engine types vs. Fatal Accidents
> Scatterplot comparing engine types with fatality counts  
> Substantial and destroyed engine damage are most commonly linked to fatal outcomes.

##  Conclusion

### ðŸ“Œ Summary of Key Findings

- **Aircraft Damage:** Fatalities are strongly associated with substantial or destroyed damage.
- **Flight Phases:** Takeoff, en-route, and landing are the most critical phases for fatal risks.
- **Trend Over Time:** Overall, aviation accidentsâ€”especially fatal onesâ€”have declined over the last two decades.

These insights support  decisions in aircraft selection and flight safety planning.
